	Abstract = {Devastating outbreaks of crown and root diseases have impacted severely on commercial strawberry production in Western Australia (W.A.). Studies were conducted to evaluate the yields, and resistance of three commercial strawberry cultivars to crown and root diseases, both in fumigated and non-fumigated field beds, and to determine the responses of eight commercial cultivars to individual pathogens under controlled conditions. In the field, cv. Camino Real showed the greatest fruit yield both in fumigated and non-fumigated beds, and was the most disease-resistant cultivar. Each cultivar had a greater fruit yield and a lower amount of plant decline in fumigated beds, compared with non-fumigated beds. Both for fumigated and non-fumigated beds, the amount of plant decline increased from August to November, particularly in non-fumigated beds. Under controlled conditions, cv. Festival was most resistant and cv. Camarosa most susceptible to wilt-causing Fusarium oxysporum. Against binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A, Cylindrocarpon destructans and Phoma exigua, cv. Festival was most resistant and cv. Aromas most susceptible. Cultivar Camino Real was the most resistant to Gnomonia fructicola and Phytophthora cactorum and cv. Festival most resistant to Pythium ultimum. Against Macrophomina phaseolina, cv. Albion was the most resistant with cv. Camarosa the most susceptible. Cultivar Camarosa, the most widely grown cultivar in W.A., was most susceptible to F. oxysporum, while cv. Camino Real was resistant to F. oxysporum both in the field and the controlled environment conditions. Cultivar Festival is the most resistant cultivar to F. oxysporum and a range of different pathogens. The Australian bred cv. Juliette was as susceptible as cv. Camarosa to F. oxysporum, but relatively resistant to binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A. This is the first study, not only to define the relative yield potentials of different cultivars in a situation where crown and root disease prevails in the field, but also to demonstrate differential resistance of current cultivars to specific pathogens associated with crown and root disease in W.A. For the first time, growers can now make informed choices about the cultivars they can deploy to minimise losses caused by diseases.},

	Abstract = {Late wilt of maize, caused by the fungus Harpophora maydis, is one of the most important fungal diseases in Egypt. The disease has also been reported from India, Hungary, Spain and Portugal. The pathogen survives for long periods in soil. Late wilt is currently controlled using maize varieties with reduced sensitivity, but virulent variants of the fungus may threaten these varieties. Common disease symptoms have been documented over 20 years in Upper Galilee (northern Israel), particularly the Hula Valley. Recently, prevalence of the disease has increased. This is the first confirmed report of the direct and primary cause of the disease in Israel. Isolates of the pathogen obtained from wilting maize plants were morphologically identical to those of strains found in Egypt and India. We modified a molecular method as a diagnostic assay of disease progress in an infested field in northern Israel. The assay identified the pathogen 50 d after seeding, before the emergence of disease symptoms, both in susceptible and partially resistant host plants. DNA assessment was consistent with the disease progress in a susceptible maize variety, and the pathogen also spread in partially resistant plants that showed no symptoms. Seeds of apparently healthy, partially resistant plants may therefore also spread the disease. A modified molecular method presented here is a preliminary step in developing a seed health assay.},

	Abstract = {Mycotoxin contamination of maize (Zea mays L.) grain is a global threat to the safety of both human food and animal feed. Hence, the development of maize genotypes with reduced mycotoxin accumulation in grain is of major importance. In order to find maize germplasm sources of resistance to Fusarium ear rot, 34 Italian and six public inbred lines were evaluated by means of artificial inoculation in field experiments during 2009 and 2010. Relationships between ear rot and fumonisin concentration in the ears were investigated. Primary ears were challenged with a mixture of two Fusarium verticillioides isolates from Northern Italy, through kernel inoculation, and ear rot severity was assessed.The average number of visibly infected kernels per ear, after inoculation, ranged from 2 to 68 in 2009 and from 0 to 120 in 2010. Fumonisin concentrations in the inoculated ears were greater than in the experimental controls for both years. Variability was found between the inbred lines: fumonisin accumulation ranged from 0.56 to 240.83 mg kg-1 in 2009 and from 1.09 to 190.60 mg kg-1 in 2010. In both years, six inbred lines showed high fumonisin content (≥100 mg kg-1), while the other genotypes were almost equally split into two groups, low (≤10 mg kg-1) and medium (from 11 to 100 mg kg-1) fumonisin content. The number of infected kernels after artificial inoculation correlated with fumonisin concentration both in 2009 (r = 0.94; P≤0.01) and 2010 (r = 0.67; P≤0.01). Additionally, the percentage of internally infected kernels correlated positively with fumonisin concentration (r = 0.37; P≤0.01) and with the number of infected kernels (r = 0.29; P≤0.05). This research has demonstrated that Italian maize germplasm is a valid source of resistance to Fusarium ear rot. Furthermore, there is a strong association of visible Fusarium symptoms with fumonisin concentration, suggesting that selection in maize for reduced visible moulds should reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination.},

	Abstract = {Pleurostomophora richardsiae (Nannf. apud Melin & Nannf.) L. Mostert, W. Gams & Crous was previously known mainly as a human pathogen. However, more recently this fungus has been isolated from wood tissue of grapevines that show Petri and esca disease symptoms in California (USA) and South Africa. During an assessment carried out in southern Italy, the abundant presence of this fungus was demonstrated by morphological, cultural and molecular means. Pleurostomophora richardsiae was isolated from sub-cortical wood patches and streaking of trunks and cordons of grapevine cultivars that showed decline and dieback symptoms. To understand its putative pathogenic role, pathogenicity tests were conducted in greenhouse experiments, where young grapevine plants of two cultivars were artificially inoculated with two isolates each of Pl. richardsiae, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Phaeoacremonium aleophilum. Within 130 d, all three fungi produced brown streaking in both grapevine cultivars. The L. theobromae and Pl. richardsiae isolates were the most aggressive. Although the Pm. aleophilum isolates were pathogenic, they induced less severe wood streaking than the other two fungi. Therefore, Pl. richardsiae is considered a fungal pathogen of grapevine. All three fungal species were re-isolated from discolored tissue of all inoculated shoots, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates.},

	Abstract = {Crown gall-affected grapevine samples were collected during 2009--2010 from major vineyards, located in different Turkish provinces. One hundred and three bacterial strains were obtained from 88 vineyards and 18 grapevine varieties; they were tumorigenic when inoculated in tobacco, sunflower and Datura stramonium plants and were identified as Rhizobium vitis using biochemical and physiological tests as well as PCR and specific primers. Nineteen R. vitis strains presented a number of anomalous biochemical and physiological characters. PCR and opine-specific primers revealed the presence of octopine/cucumopine-type plasmid in 82 R. vitis strains, nopaline-type plasmids in 18 strains and vitopine-type plasmids in three strains. Clonal relationship of strains was determined using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis following digestion of genomic DNA with the restriction endonuclease PmeI. The greatest genetic diversity was found for the strains from Denizli, Ankara and Nev{\c s}ehir provinces. Nopaline and vitopine-types of Rhizobium vitis were detected for the first time in Turkey.},

	Abstract = {This study examined the capacity of Rhizobium sp. strain PchAZM to reduce parasitism of chickpea by Orobanche foetida under greenhouse conditions, and assessed the relative impact of rhizobia on the expression of chickpea defense response against broomrape. Growth chamber experiments using Petri dishes revealed that rhizobia infection on chickpea roots reduced broomrape seed germination, and restricted the broomrape attachment to host roots while retarding tubercle formation and development by the parasite. In pot experiments, chickpea roots inoculated with rhizobia reduced the total number of broomrape by up to 90%. Broomrape necrosis was observed both before and after parasite attachment to inoculated chickpea roots in Petri dishes and pot experiments. Reduction in infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of the defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POX). Increased levels of phenolics were recorded in the roots of rhizobia-inoculated plants grown in the presence of broomrape. The results suggest that rhizobia could be used for protection of chickpea against O. foetida.},

	Abstract = {Resumen. La malformaci{\'{o}}n es una de las enfermedades m{\'{a}}s importantes del mango en el {\'{a}}mbito mundial. Varias especies de Fusarium han sido identificadas como agentes causales de esta enfermedad. Recientemente, una nueva especie, F. mexicanum, fue descrita causando malformaci{\'{o}}n en huertas de mango de la regi{\'{o}}n centro occidente de M{\'{e}}xico; sin embargo, esta especie no ha sido detectada en {\'{a}}reas productoras del Golfo de M{\'{e}}xico. Durante los {\'{u}}ltimos a{\~{n}}os, se ha presentado un incremento en las huertas de mango que presentan malformaci{\'{o}}n en Jalisco, un estado localizado al norte del {\'{a}}rea donde F. mexicanum ha sido detectado. El objetivo de este trabajo fue identificar el pat{\'{o}}geno causante de la malformaci{\'{o}}n floral y vegetativa en Jalisco. An{\'{a}}lisis morfol{\'{o}}gico y gen{\'{e}}tico de los genes {\ss} tubulina, EF-1{\'{a}}, e histona H3, mostr{\'{o}} que todos los aislados estudiados fueron F. mexicanum.

An{\'{a}}lisis filogen{\'{e}}ticos mostraron que F. mexicanum pudiera estar presente como poblaciones clonales cuya dispersi{\'{o}}n pudo haber ocurrido por medio de la comercializaci{\'{o}}n de plantas de vivero contaminadas.

We constructed a virus vector based on White clover mosaic virus (WClMV) and demonstrated VIGS of phytoene desaturase (PDS) in pea. Photobleaching of tissues, caused by VIGS of PDS, was observed in restricted areas of upper leaves and stems. We confirmed that the PDS mRNA and subgenomic RNAs of WClMV were reduced in the photobleached tissues.},

A fungus, isolated from the ascospores that had formed on the leaf spot, was demonstrated to reproduce the symptoms on leaves and described as a new species, Adisciso kaki, based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. This fungus is characterized by small ascomata without clypeus, obclavate to broadly cylindrical asci with an amyloid apical apparatus, and hyaline ascospores with a submedian septum. We coined the name black leaf spot (Kurohoshi-rakuyo-byo, in Japanese) for the new disease.},

@article{Toyoda_2012,
	Abstract = {A model pathosystem involving Mycosphaerella pinodes, causal agent of Mycosphaerella blight on pea and barrel medic(k) Medicago truncatula has been developed. Nineteen M. truncatula ecotypes were evaluated for disease susceptibility to M. pinodes strain OMP-1, using detached leaves inoculated with a pycnospore suspension. Inoculation of ecotype R108-1 with the pycnospores allowed direct penetration into the host's epidermal cells, eventually causing leaf spots. Since pycnidia formed abundantly in infected tissues by 3 days post inoculation, M. pinodes is considered to have completed its infection cycle as on a natural host plant. Expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)-, chalcone synthase (CHS)- and isoflavone reductase (IFR) mRNAs as well as subsequent accumulation of a major phytoalexin, medicarpin, was induced in ecotype R108-1 with an elicitor preparation from M. pinodes, whereas this phytoalexin response was markedly attenuated by supprescins from the same fungus. A transcriptional study of a salicylic acid (SA)-regulated gene encoding pathogenesis-related protein 10-1 (PR10-1) indicated that the suppressor likely interferes with the signal transduction process leading to inducible defenses in M. truncatula. Indeed, the suppressor rendered the host tissues (ecotype R108-1) susceptible to unrelated nonpathogenic fungi, probably through targeting ATPase activity of the host cells. Accordingly, the resistant and susceptible response of pea can be recapitulated in M. truncatula. This model pathosystem thus will allow us to verify the molecular basis underlying the fungal suppressor-mediated plant susceptibility.},

	Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are distributed throughout the genome and play an important role in genome variation of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. TE-associated molecular markers have been developed and used extensively for diversity analysis in natural populations. Here, we investigated the genomic distribution of a selected group of TEs that are dispersed as singletons, and each is of a size feasible for PCR validation, designated as SSTEs, in the genome of the reference laboratory strain, 70-15. The 75 SSTEs identified were distributed evenly on seven chromosomes of the M. oryzae genome. Approximately 40 {\%} of SSTEs were located either in the coding or promoter regions of the predicted genes. The presence or absence of each SSTE at the respective locus was assessed, resolving significant presence/absence polymorphism among 11 rice blast strains collected from different locations worldwide. The presence/absence (P/A) polymorphism of SSTEs in different strains suggests that they may be useful for developing map-based land PATE markers for genetic analysis in M. oryzae.              },

Eighty-two exotic Gambian and Malian germplasms and 10 sorghum lines commonly used as SDM pathotype differentials were field-evaluated in a randomized complete block design replicated three times at one Mexican location (Ocotl{\'a}n, Jalisco) in 2004 and 2005, and two USA locations (Louise and New Taiton, TX, USA) in 2005 to identify new sources of SDM resistance. Accessions PI609151 and PI609442 from Mali had high levels of SDM resistance at all locations. Malian accession PI612815 also had a moderate to resistant reaction to SDM in two of the three locations. Accession PI522108 from Gambia was resistant in Mexico but susceptible in Louise, TX, USA. The reaction of the 10 lines used as differentials suggested the presence of a pathotype in Mexico that differed from those in the USA.},

	Abstract = {The global regulator LaeA is required for the expression of biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans. To learn more about the regulation of these genes in Alternaria alternata, which has at least seven pathogenic variants (pathotypes) that produce host-specific toxins (HSTs) and cause severe diseases in their host plants, we identified LaeA homologs encoding methyltransferase in tomato, strawberry and apple pathotypes of A. alternata, designating them AtLAE1, AsLAE1 and AaLAE1, respectively. In the AtLAE1-deleted mutant of the tomato pathotype (∆AtLAE1), expression of the AAL-toxin biosynthetic gene ALT1 was lower than that in the wild type. Correspondingly, AAL-toxin production and virulence of the mutant were significantly lower as were spore production and hyphal growth. Similarly, the AsLAE1-deleted mutant of the strawberry pathotype (∆AsLAE1) and the AaLAE1-deleted mutant of the apple pathotype (∆AaLAE1) produced less of their host-specific toxin (AF- and AM-toxin, respectively), had reduced virulence on the host plant, and hyphal growth and sporulation were defective. Thus, the global regulator gene LaeA positively regulates HST biosynthesis, pathogenicity, growth and differentiation in A. alternata pathotypes.},

	Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (RKN) are obligate endoparasites that severely damage the host root system. Nutrient and water uptake are substantially reduced in infested plants, resulting into altered physiological processes and reduced plant growth. The effect of nematode infestation on the morphological changes of roots and subsequent physiological plant responses of infested tomatoes with the RKN Meloidogyne ethiopica was studied in a pot experiment. Plants were infested with two inoculum densities (10 or 50 eggs per cm3 substrate) and its effect was evaluated 74 and 102 days post inoculation (DPI). Morphological changes and root growth was determined by analysing scanned images of the whole root system. Nematode infestation reduced the portion of fine roots and increased that of coarse roots due to gall formation. Fine roots of non-infested control plants represented around 51{\%} of the area of the whole root system at 74 and 102 DPI. In comparison to controls, plants inoculated with low and high nematode density had 2.1 and 3.2-times lower surface area of fine roots at 102 DPI. Root analyses revealed that plants had a very limited ability to mitigate the effects of the root-knot nematodes infestation by altering root growth. Root galls had a major influence on the hydraulic conductivity of the root system, which was significantly reduced. The low leaf water potential of infested plants coincided with decreased stomatal conductivity, transpiration and photosynthesis. The latter two were reduced by 60--70{\%} when compared to non-infested control plants.},

The nucleotide diversity estimated from the nucleotide distances of the CVd-V Pakistan population was similar to that reported from other countries. Based on genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis, two main CVd-V groups were identified indicating that Pakistan might be one of the geographic origins of CVd-V worldwide. We demonstrated that this viroid has not emerged recently and it is more widespread than previously expected.},

	Abstract = {Mating-type (MAT) locus-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be sufficient for conventional PCR-based differentiation of Pyrenophora teres f. teres (Ptt) and P. teres f. maculata (Ptm), the cause of the net and spot form, respectively, of barley net blotch. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the MAT locus from 10 California isolates that cause atypical blotch symptoms on barley. Analysis of the full-length nucleotide sequences of one MAT1-1 (1,993 bp) and nine MAT1-2 (2,149 or 2,161 bp) idiomorphs revealed high (98--99 {\%}) similarity to those of Ptt isolates. However, distinct SNP patterns were identified in the newly cloned MAT idiomorphs. Two new MAT1-2-specific SNPs were found to be conserved in one Australia and eight California isolates that all cause similar atypical blotch symptoms. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all 10 California isolates form a separate branch (or clade) within the Ptt group, except for one that appears to be ancestral to both Ptt and Ptm. PCR primers designed based on the identified SNP patterns were used successfully to differentiate each atypical isolate from highly virulent forms. This study extends our previous work and, taken together, the results demonstrate that the genetic variation at the MAT locus correlates with variation in the form-specific disease phenotype, and that MAT-specific SNPs can serve as reliable and convenient markers for subspecies level differentiation in P. teres, an economically important plant-pathogenic ascomycete (                  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single{\_}nucleotide{\_}polymorphism                                  ).},

Thus, the objective of this study was to reveal the genetic diversity of Colletotrichum isolates in Mexican papaya fields. C. gloeosporioides-and C. capsici-specific primers were successfully used to detect the pathogens from different papaya parts. A combination of morphological characters, molecular techniques and pathogenicity tests were used to characterize 37 isolates from different localities of five papaya-producing states. Analyses of the 5.8-ITS region and arbitrarily primed-PCR revealed intraspecific groups; most of the isolates within these groups have the same geographical location and morphological characteristics. Knowledge of the genetic diversity of Colletotrichum spp. in Mexican papaya fields will facilitate the identification of the pathogen population in this crop in order to select the appropriate fungicide to control anthracnose, as well as to improve genetic resistance breeding programs.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the role of pericarp phenylpropanoids as resistance factors to F. verticillioides in eleven maize genotypes. Disease severity and kernel fumonisin accumulation were measured after inoculation with F. verticillioides and related to contents of pericarp phenylpropanoids in field trials conducted during 2 years. Grain fumonisin concentrations were highly dependant on disease severity of the genotypes (r{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.88). A detailed analysis of pericarp phenylpropanoids indicated the presence of trans-ferulic acid (tFA), cis-ferulic acid (cFA), p-coumaric acid (pCA), and five diferulates (DFAs). The most prominent diferulates were 8,5{\textasciiacutex}-diferulic acid benzofuram form (8,5{\textasciiacutex}-DFAbz), followed by 8,5{\textasciiacutex}-DFA and 8,8{\textasciiacutex}-DFA. Except for cFA, the most resistant genotypes exhibited high levels of phenylpropanoids which were related to low levels of disease severity and grain fumonisin concentration (−0.61 > r{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}−0.90). A stepwise regression analysis revealed that total diferulates was the best explanatory parameter for variability of disease severity (r                2{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.71). Grain fumonisin concentration was well depicted by contents of total diferulates, 8,5{\textasciiacutex}DFAbz and pCA (r                2{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.82). Our findings suggest that high level of phenylpropanoids in the kernel pericarp is a trait associated to less disease severity and fumonisin accumulation caused by F. verticillioides. Further research is in progress to map quantitative trait loci for these cell wall components in bi-parental populations derived by crossing resistant and susceptible genotypes included in this study.},

In this work, the optimal growth conditions for large-scale studies of barrage formation in the asexual fungus Verticillium dahliae were determined, and they were used for the analysis of a diverse collection comprising 69 isolates of V. dahliae and related species. Barrage formation was very frequent on a defined complete agar medium within V. dahliae and between species of the genus. However, it was not correlated with the classification of V. dahliae isolates into Vegetative Compatibility Groups (VCGs) (based on the standard method using complementary nit mutants), as it was recorded at high frequencies both within and between V. dahliae VCGs. The high overall frequency of barrage formation demonstrated the presence of a higher level of mycelial incompatibility in V. dahliae than heterokaryon incompatibility assessed by forcing complementary nit mutants to form heterokaryons under selective conditions. The possible association of barrage formation with morphological characteristics of the fungal colonies was investigated, and a negative correlation of frequency and intensity of barrages with the isolates' capacity for pigment production was detected.},

	Abstract = {One of the most efficient mechanisms by which plants protect themselves from viruses is the specific RNA-dependent silencing pathway termed post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Inhibition of Tobacco mosaic                virus in tobacco was demonstrated through transient expression of virus-derived short hairpin RNA encoding the methyltransferase domain of TMV replicase corresponding to the nucleotides 630 to 1,510 introduced through agro-infiltration into the leaves of tobacco plants. RT-PCR revealed that TMV infection was absent in hpRNA agro-infiltrated leaves while control leaves showed amplification of TMV. Protein analysis further confirmed the absence of TMV coat protein in hpRNA-containing leaves while it was prominent in the control leaves. Our data demonstrate that expression of hpRNA is an effective and predictable new approach to engineering resistance to TMV.},

	Abstract = {To control downy mildew of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), incited by Peronospora belbahrii Thines, a number of compounds were tested in 2011 and 2012 under glasshouse conditions. These included copper-based fungicides, biocontrol agents, and compounds previously reported to induce resistance in plants to pathogens. Results were compared with those provided by fungicides registered for downy mildew control in Italy. The tested compounds were used alone or applied in rotation in spray programs. In all trials, the greatest reduction in disease incidence and severity was found with treatments that included metalaxyl-M{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}copper hydroxide, a mineral fertilizer `Alexin', mandipropanid, and azoxystrobin. The glucohumates activator complex and acibenzolar-S-methyl also provided significant disease control (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). The mineral fertilizer Alexin, the glucohumates activator complex and acibenzolar-S significantly reduced disease incidence and severity 20 days after the last treatment compared with the untreated control (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). Among the copper-based products, the greatest reductions in disease incidence and severity were provided by copper hydroxide with terpenic alcohols and copper oxychloride{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}copper hydroxide. The mineral fertilizer Kendal and prohexadione-Ca, as well as mustard oil, partially reduced disease incidence and severity compared with the untreated control (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05), whereas the biocontrol agent Bacillus subtilis QST 713 and thyme oil extract were not effective in two out of three trials. When different combinations of various products used in rotation were tested, effective control was found either using a rotation of fungicides with compounds that can induce resistance, as well as by using rotation with different resistance-inducing compounds on their own.},

The effect of a treatment with a fungal elicitor on the response of tomato fruit to Fusarium oxysporum infection and changes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway was studied. Fungal elicitor retarded for 3 days the development of the Fusarium rot development in tomato, at concentration of 2 g{\thinspace}l                        −1 (B2-F treatment). This treatment also induced a 3.11- and 6.03-fold increase of caffeic and chlorogenic acids, respectively, as compared with the control. Furthermore, the flavonoids naringenin-7-O-glucoside, rutin and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, showed a greater abundance in tomato under the B2-F treatment after 6 days at 20{\textdegree}C. It is concluded that the fungal elicitor reduced the development of Fusarium rot by inducing the biosynthesis of metabolites from the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway which forms part of the defense response in tomato fruit.},

EB was successfully injected and translocated in pines at an effective concentration. None of the treated trees died after a period of 26 months, contrasting with a 33{\%} mortality of non-treated pines. Analysis of residues successfully detected EB in branches of treated pines, with the quantity increasing relative to the injection dose rate, and was found to have a clear effect on the longevity and feeding activity of adult M. galloprovincialis feeding on branches. EB was efficient in preventing wilt disease and bark beetle attacks in the terrain, and its application by trunk injection is a new option for wilt disease management programs in Portugal and in Europe.},

	Abstract = {The temporal and spatial distribution of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) was studied in a 2,085 m2 tomato field with a total of 4,080 plants during 10 weeks from 5 July to 6 September in 2004. First infected plants were detected 4 weeks after the source plants were placed in the field and their number continued to increase by week 7. A total of 147 plants (3.6{\%}) were recorded to be infected according to symptom occurrence and serological test by the end of the experiment. Thrips monitoring was carried out from May 25 to October 25 in the same year. Two thrips species, Frankliniella intonsa (Tryborn) and Thrips tabaci (Lindemann), were determined in the experimental area, with the latter one being the more prevalent (84.9{\%}) species. There was a significant correlation (r{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.988, P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.01) between the number of thrips species and the number of infected plants in the field. Majority of infected plants were not located near (0--10 m) an internal virus source within the experimental area, whereas 45.6{\%} of the infected plants were located at a distance of 21--30 m. The number of infected plants at a distance of 21--25 m was significantly higher than at all other distances (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). There was no gradual increase in the distances of TSWV-infected plants within 0--30 m as time progressed. The virus seems to be transmitted by vectors through primary infections and scattered within 30-m distance, but limited secondary infections seem likely to occur after this distance in the case of a small internal virus source.},

This contrasts with earlier reports of anthracnose occurring on bell pepper primarily as a ripe-rot disease of mature, colored pepper fruit caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Management of anthracnose on green bell pepper fruit using fungicides and a commercial inducer of systemic acquired resistance, acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), was evaluated during three seasons. In two of the three trials, all the fungicides tested including azoxystrobin, fludioxonil + cyprodinil, mancozeb, famoxadone + cymoxanil, copper hydroxide, and ASM significantly increased the number of marketable fruit compared with control plants. These trials identified fungicides that could contribute to a successful pest management program on pepper for controlling anthracnose caused by C. acutatum. The cross-infectivity potential of C. acutatum was investigated on tomato and strawberry by in vitro and field inoculation. Anthracnose lesions formed readily on wound-inoculated detached fruits of all hosts in in vitro assays. Under field conditions, after inoculation, anthracnose lesions occurred on pepper fruit but no lesions of anthracnose were found on either ripe or unripe tomato or strawberry fruit in adjacent plots.},

The disease severity ({\%}) and the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) for each of the Fomg isolates were calculated by scale values. Results showed that neither of the resistant lines (LS1934 and LS2436) exhibited wilting symptoms, whereas susceptible local cultivars (cvs. `Kemer' and `Hadrian') displayed severe disease symptoms. There was no significant variation in the virulence, indicating the occurrence of a race or races among 70 Fomg isolates tested on resistant lines and susceptible cultivars. This may indicate a genetically homogeneous population structure of Fomg in Turkey.},

Genetic analysis of ToCV isolates was explored based on sequence data of viral segments within the coat protein (CP), the heat shock protein (HSP70h) and the polymerase protein (RdRp). Synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitution rates and their ratio were analyzed. The patterns of mutations were shaped depending on the considered fragment from the three viral regions. Selective neutrality test was significantly negative, suggesting a recent expansion of ToCV isolates. Pairwise mismatch distribution gave a bimodal pattern and pointed to the clustering of ToCV isolates into two distinct geographical clades. Genetic haplotype network provided evidence of the existence of two distinct clusters. The star-like shaped pattern confirmed recent expansion of ToCV isolates.},

This study was conducted to identify and characterize the pathogens responsible for anthracnose disease in bell peppers (C. annuum L.) in Trinidad. Seventy-two percent of all isolates were Colletotrichum truncatum and 28{\%} were C. gloeosporioides. Growth rate and conidia dimensions were reliable morphological markers that allowed differentiation between C. gloeosporioides and C. truncatum isolates. Benomyl sensitivity testing also distinguished between isolates of C. gloeosporioides and C. truncatum. C. truncatum was resistant to benomyl at all concentrations tested while C. gloeosporioides sensu lato was sensitive to concentrations above 0.1 $\mu$g ml-1 . Pathogenicity tests demonstrated different levels of resistance to anthracnose in various Capsicum genotypes. C. gloeosporioides sensu lato isolates caused significantly greater damage than C. truncatum isolates regardless of pepper cultivar. PCR with taxon- and species-specific primers produced amplicons of expected band sizes for all Colletotrichum species and only for C. gloeosporioides, respectively. Molecular analysis of ITS and $\beta$-tubulin sequences positioned C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. truncatum isolates from bell pepper into separate species-specific clusters.},

	Abstract = {Insect-borne viruses promote several changes in plant phenotype, which can modify plant-vector interactions in favor of virus survival and dissemination. Although co-infections commonly occur in the field, little is known about their effects on interactions with the vector. The ecological interactions between Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) and its aphid vector, Rhopalosiphum padi, have been investigated extensively, but the vector's behavior in more complex scenarios has yet to be examined. We assessed olfactory response and performance of R. padi to wheat singly and doubly infected by the pathogenic fungus Giberella zeae and BYDV. Non-viruliferous aphids preferred odors of BYDV-infected wheat over healthy wheat, as previously reported in the literature, and they were still preferentially attracted to BYDV-infected plant during co-infection. However, around 35{\%} more non-viruliferous aphids chose healthy wheat over G. zeae-infected wheat. Viruliferous aphids did not show any preference to the treatments. BYDV-infected wheat was a superior host than healthy wheat for the aphids whose population increased in 25{\%}. We observed a synergistic effect of the co-infected wheat, which was the best host for aphids, and promoted an elevation of 42{\%} on population growth. Our results indicate that co-infection might be beneficial for virus spread as does not interfere with aphid olfactory preference and provides greater colony growth than in singly infected plants.},

The savory and thyme essential oils showed a significant pathogen control activity because of their innate antifungal activity and because of the seed application method, but the dry hot pre-treatment did not show any obvious effect on the performance of the essential oil treatments. The dry heat treatment improved the Pseudomonas seed dressing effect against F.oxysporum f. sp. basilici, and showed important reductions in plant infection and the disease index on the treated seed plants, without any negative effect on seed germination. However, the pathogen control provided by the heat treatments combined with the application of the biocontrol agents never reached the same performance as the chemical treatments considered as the reference.

Del. and on-farm weeds on severity of dry root rot caused by Macrophomina phaseolina in relation to microbial population dynamics, microbial activity and on seed yield of guar was ascertained. In general, during crop growth compost amended plots retained 16 {\%} higher soil moisture than non-amended plots. Populations of total fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes increased in the amended plots during the crop season. The maximum population of total fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria were recorded in A. nilotica, P. juliflora and weeds compost-amended treatments, respectively. Microbial activity was also 26.1 {\%} higher in amended compared to non-amended plots. Amendment of soil with composts resulted in increases in the concentration of micronutrients and significant reduction in plant mortality due to dry root rot. Beneficial effects of composts were also discernible in yield promotion where 40 {\%} increase in the seed yield was recorded in P. juliflora compost-amended plots. These results suggests that in arid regions of India, certain on-farm wastes can be effectively utilized for managing Macrophomina induced diseases besides enhancing crop productivity.},

	Abstract = {The causal agent of myrtle rust, initially described as Uredo rangelii, was recorded in Australia for the first time in 2010. Much of the monitoring effort in Australia and elsewhere is driven by existing understanding of Puccinia psidii sensu lato (guava rust), because U. rangelii is part of the guava rust complex. Bioclimatic analyses for guava rust in Australia indicate highest risk along the eastern coast, from northern Queensland to the south coast of NSW. These analyses rely on native and invaded range records for Puccinia psidii sensu lato. However, models that are instead fitted to records representing U. rangelii emphasise different risk areas, with less focus on northern coastal Queensland and new predictions into NSW tablelands and north-eastern Victoria. These differences have important implications for biosecurity containment and monitoring efforts. Here we use this example as a case study to explore the implications of taxonomic uncertainty for predictions of the potential distribution of a species of biosecurity concern in Australia. The important message is that the different patterns implied by different taxonomic assumptions may have very different management implications and taxonomic uncertainty should be evaluated alongside other sources of uncertainty. We could find no published example where taxonomic uncertainty was evaluated in biosecurity planning, despite the fact that taxonomic uncertainties are common. We outline how to model such uncertainties and discuss methods for exploring them and their impacts on predicted distributions.},

	Abstract = {This study investigated the susceptibility of the most common rootstock and scion varieties used in New Zealand grapevine nurseries and vineyards to Botryosphaeriaceae species. A total of six rootstocks and six scion varieties were inoculated with mycelium of three isolates each of the most common Botryosphaeriaceae species (Neofusicoccum luteum, N. parvum and N. australe) recovered from New Zealand grapevine nurseries. Overall results showed that all isolates produced necrotic lesions on all varieties but susceptibility varied significantly (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001) with 5C and SO4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions. Pathogenicity also varied significantly (P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001) between species with N. parvum being the most virulent among three species tested. This study has further shown that different isolates of the three species have different levels of virulence providing evidence that these pathogens are genetically diverse. These results have significant implications for the New Zealand grapevine industry as the use of resistant varieties is not a possible option at present since none of the common varieties are resistant to these pathogens.},

	Abstract = {We developed an improved solution culture technique that enabled clear and comprehensive observation of dynamic root hair infection by Plasmodiophora brassicae. Brassica oleracea seedlings were sown directly into 10 mL centrifuge tubes containing half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution. Seedlings were fastened in 1 cm thick foam in the tube top and tubes were wrapped with black tape to block light and prevent algal growth. Maximal root hair infection was observed under conditions of pH 5.5, temperature of 20 to 25 {\textdegree}C, and an inoculation concentration of 1{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}107 spores/mL. Infection efficiency was obviously higher in fresh nutrient. Under optimum infection conditions, plasmodia were found in the root hair 4 days after inoculation (DAI), with some undergoing cleavage and developing into round zoosporangia 3 days later. At ten DAI, the number of root hairs containing zoosporangia per root reached 208, and the cytoplasm within the zoosporangia began to cleave and form incipient zoospores. Most zoosporangia released the zoospores and became diaphanous at ten DAI. Root hairs became swollen during the experimental trial and small galls appeared clearly on the root at 20 DAI. In addition, sectioned specimens showed that some cortical cells contained resting spores. We sequentially tested the germination of the resting spores in tubes from 1 to 11 DAI and the temporal dynamics of germination corresponding to the infection. Zoosporangia were found in epidermal cells at the same time as in the root hair.},

In addition to being associated with finger lime, the isolate from finger lime could cause scab symptoms on C. {\texttimes} aurantium cv. Murcott tangor in pathogenicity tests, but could not cause scab symptoms on the other orange, mandarin, lemon or grapefruit tested. Pathogenicity tests also support previous studies showing the isolate from jojoba could not produce symptoms on fruit of C. natsudaidai. Based on the findings of this study, two novel pathotypes of E. australis are designated from Australia; namely the Finger Lime (FL) pathotype associated with finger lime, and the Jojoba Black Scab (JBS) pathotype associated with black scab of jojoba. The significance of these novel E. australis pathotypes on market access and biosecurity issues for citrus are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {In Brazil, Pratylenchus brachyurus damages economic important crops and it is managed with non-chemical methods such as crop rotation or resistant cultivars. However, the variability in reproduction and damaging effects observed among P. brachyurus populations could limit the efficacy and long lasting effect of nematode control practices. Twelve populations of P. brachyurus from different geographical areas of Brazil were analyzed morphologically and molecularly. The morphological and morphometric characters of the populations studied were variable, but fitted those of P. brachyurus. Assemblages of populations with different host preferences and reproductive capabilities were revealed by PCA of these populations using selected morphological characters. Phylogenetic analysis using ITS-rDNA sequences distinguished statistically supported groups of sequences that matched those of other populations of P. brachyurus deposited in the GenBank, confirming the identity of populations here studied. Intraspecific sequence diversity was observed among the populations. These variant sequences suggest the presence of microheterogeneity between ITS-1 copies in individuals. The findings of this study did not provide evidence of cryptic species in the P. brachyurus populations studied. The variability within and among populations of P. brachyurus observed in this work must be taken into consideration in breeding programs for resistance to this nematode.},

	Abstract = {Curvularia lunata produces a non-host specific toxin known as methyl 5-(hydroxymethyl) furan-2-carboxylate (M5HF2C), a determinant of high virulence to maize. We constructed mutants through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and found that mutant T806 showed a significant decline in pathogenicity on maize leaves and produced no detectable M5HF2C. Although the tagged gene (Clt-1) has been cloned and demonstrated to be closely association with M5HF2C production and pathogenicity, we expected hypothesized that other proteins might also be related to toxin production. Therefore we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to profile T806, and found that there were two up-regulated and six missing proteins in T806 compared to C. lunata wild-type CX-3. These results indicated that these proteins were associated with signal transduction, protein synthesis, secondary metabolism and pathogenicity. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of five selected genes showed a correlation between low gene expression and detection of the corresponding proteins. Of these, dihydropteroate (DHFA) synthase may be more likely involved in M5HF2C biosynthesis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that DHFA synthase consists of 469 amino acids, which is clustered into one branch with dothideomycete DHFA synthase homolologs in a phylogenetic tree. Further study on the exact role of the DHFA synthase gene is underway.},

	Abstract = {The variation in disease incidence of bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum among eucalypt clones (Eucalyptus spp.) in the field indicates that the disease may be controlled by planting resistant material. However, efficient inoculation methods for bacterial wilt on eucalypt are scarce and have low replicability. In this work, we developed an effective protocol for inoculation of R. solanacearum, which was subsequently validated on different eucalypt clones. Three methods were tested: (i) soil infestation with bacterial cell suspension; (ii) immersion of wounded roots in the bacterial cell suspension; and (iii) injection of bacterial cell suspension in the base of the stem. The injection method proved to be the most efficient for inoculating eucalypt with R. solanacearum. Differentiation between resistant and susceptible clones was observed 30 days after inoculation in independent assays. Base stem inoculation of 21 eucalypt clones showed that four clones, classified as resistant, did not exhibit wilt symptoms or bacterial ooze at the end of the experiment. Although no wilting symptoms were observed, four other clones were considered susceptible because at least one plant showed bacterial ooze from the inoculated tissue. The remaining 13 clones were highly susceptible, presenting typical wilt symptoms and bacterial ooze.},

Agricultural practices, combined with chemical control involving 8--12 annual fungicide applications, are known to be very effective against CBD, especially in high altitude regions (&gt;1600 m) where the most damaged coffee farms are found. Temperatures and rainfall may be key factors in the development of \{CBD\} epidemics. Therefore, an epidemiological study was conducted on smallholding coffee farms in Cameroon, to assess the dependence of disease development on variations in these climatic factors. Cross-correlations between disease severity and climatic parameters recorded weekly were estimated over two successive years (2004--2005), revealing a significant increase in disease severity in line with decreasing temperatures (minimum or maximum). They also indicated a large variation in disease severity depending on the number of raining days during berry growth. However, no significant correlation was found with the quantity of rainfall over the two years of observations. Thus, temperatures and rainfall distribution appear to be the key climatic parameters that favor the development of \{CBD\} epidemics. These results suggest that temperature and rainfall parameters might be very useful for establishing predictive models to optimize effective \{CBB\} control in areas with a high disease incidence. },

	Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted to study the efficacy of six fungicides comprising contact, systemic and botanical fungicides and three biocontrol agents for the management of bird's eye spot disease in tea plantations. Among 16 treatments, systemic fungicides were found to be superior to biocontrol agents in controlling the disease whereas the maximum green leaf yield was significantly increased in those applied with biocontrol agents. On the whole, Streptomyces sannanensis offered the maximum yield of 3998 kg ha−1 made tea followed by Trichoderma harzianum (3884 kg ha−1 made tea). Between the two different carrier materials evaluated for the application of biocontrol agents, vermicompost-based bioformulation showed better efficacy than talc-based formulation. Of the three (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) groups of biocontrol agents, S. sannanensis was better than Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma atroviride belonging to bacterial and fungal antagonists; respectively in terms of disease protection and increasing yield potential. Similarly, the biometric, physiological and biochemical parameters were also increased in plants greatly after imposing various treatments. Plucking surface of the bush, number of plucking points per unit area, internodal length, leaf moisture and dry matter contents were found higher in plots applied with biocontrol agents than those treated with fungicides. Almost all of the tea quality parameters such as total liquor colour, thearubigins, theaflavins, highly polymerized substance and caffeine were significantly improved in biocontrol treated plants. Theaflavin and thearubigin contents were increased in the range of 9.00--9.57% and 1.27--1.54% respectively in vermin based treatment. Similarly the amount of caffeine content (3.66--4.08%) and flavour index (4.18--5.31%) were considerably enhanced. },

	Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) availability is a key factor influencing the yield of Brassica napus L. Thus, mineral fertilization is widely used to improve the quality and quantity of seeds. In this study, we conducted field experiments to determine the impact of nitrogen fertilization on B. napus pests, their parasitoids and plant diseases. The results showed that N treatment had an impact on the abundance of pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus Fab.) and cabbage seed weevils (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus Marsh.) as well as dark spot disease (Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc.). Since pest abundance was not correlated with the flower and silique numbers, the feeding and oviposition sites, plant smell bouquets were analysed to determine potentially attractive or repellent volatile organic compounds. We detected 19 different compounds among which acetic acid and several lipoxygenase pathway products were emitted at higher levels from N-treated plants. Emission of a few other terpenoid compounds was correlated with the pest abundance in field conditions. Abundance of parasitoids of both pests was related to the host availability rather than to the fertilization treatment. Therefore, we suggest that plant chemical cues play a minor role in localization of hosts in close proximity to parasitoid. Dark spot disease levels decreased with increasing N availability, possibly reflecting enhanced emissions of acetic acid, a known antifungal volatile. This study demonstrates the effects of N fertilization on bud and flower volatile bouquets, which might play a role in B. napus insect pest host selection and in resistance to fungal plant diseases. Further studies are necessary to investigate the behavioural responses of insects to the changed volatile bouquets. },

	Abstract = {Both sheath blight and blast are important rice diseases worldwide. The exploration of environmentally sound practices to control these diseases will help to reduce fungicide application. Effects of rice (Oryza sativa) intercropping with water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) on rice sheath blight and rice blast disease as well as the extracts of different plant parts and root exudates from water chestnut on pathogens of rice sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) and rice blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) were investigated using pot experiments and bioassay tests. The results from pot tests showed that rice-water chestnut intercropping system suppressed sheath blight and blast and improved land equivalent ratio (LER). The results from bioassay tests indicated that extracts and root exudates from water chestnut had significant effects to inhibit the expansion of these pathogens. The scales of these inhibitions were time and concentration dependent. The antifungal activities of the extracts from aboveground parts and pulp of water chestnut were significantly higher than the extracts from other parts and root exudates. The water extracts of aboveground parts showed the highest antifungal activity on both pathogens according to \{EC50\} values. The antifungal activities of the same extracts from water chestnut on R. solani were significantly higher than on M. oryzae. The result suggests that water chestnut possesses bioactive substances to suppress rice sheath blight disease and rice blast disease. The rice-water chestnut intercropping system can be used as an environment-friendly method for diseases control in rice field. },

@article{Collange_2014,
	Abstract = {Abstract Vegetable production makes an intensive use of pesticides, and a major challenge is to build alternative cropping systems that can control pests and diseases with fewer uses of chemical products. An on-farm analysis was conducted in Southeast France to assess the efficacy of several cropping systems in simultaneously controlling two major pests: root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and lettuce drop due to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Ten cropping systems resulting from the combinations of three crop sequences and two alternative techniques, solarization and green manure, were assessed during two years. The use of solarization once a year or once every two years limited the occurrence of S. sclerotiorum. Sorghum green manure tended to increase S. sclerotiorum incidence; the effect was positively correlated with green manure duration. Especially when no vegetable was cropped in summer, the green manure crop duration was lengthened and this probably created soil conditions favorable to the development of the fungus. The incidence of root-knot nematodes was largely dependent on crop rotation: a melon crop in summer increased its incidence on the subsequent lettuce crops whereas a summer sorghum cover crop had no effect. The cropping systems that limited Sclerotinia development in soil tended to support the root-knot nematode populations. These results should motivate farmers and advisers to adopt a systemic analysis and take into account the various interactions among inoculum level, soil characteristics, crop rotations, and technical management options for designing sustainable vegetable production systems. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In 2006, the golden nematode, Globodera rostochiensis, a regulated pest causing heavy losses in potato fields was discovered in Quebec, Canada. The rapid application of quarantine measures by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency significantly changed the use and management of infested fields. The objectives of this study were to assess the evolution of weed populations following these measures and assess their impact on the management of G. rostochiensis. A comparison of weed inventories conducted in 2008 and 2011 on the edges of the affected fields has shown that the composition of the flora had changed considerably. Alarmingly, the presence of Solanaceae that could potentially serve as host plants for the potato cyst nematode increased significantly. The biodiversity index was also significantly affected by this change and decreased by more than 50% between the two years. Interestingly, the lowest biodiversity was observed in one of the few fields where potatoes were grown in 2011 and where an explosion of Solanum sarrachoides was observed. Meanwhile, eight species of nightshade were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of G. rostochiensis. Solanum villosum allowed the greatest rates of reproduction while only a few cysts were produced on Solanum nigrum and Solanum dulcamara. This study has shown that the modifications in weed control regimes associated with the implementation of quarantine procedures could hamper its success by favouring the multiplication of potential pest refuges. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Groundnut rosette virus disease (GRVD) is the major constraint to groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) production in Uganda. It is principally transmitted by the groundnut aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch). The disease is known to cause total crop failure in cases where susceptible varieties are used. During any particular season, \{GRVD\} displays variations in incidence and severity in different agro-ecologies within the country, but the reasons for the varying disease patterns remain unclear. This study was aimed at establishing the factors influencing the occurrence of \{GRVD\} in Uganda. Trials were established for three seasons in four groundnut growing locations situated in different agro-ecologies in Uganda. Four groundnut genotypes were used as treatments in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Disease progress and aphid populations were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after planting. Data on environmental factors; particularly rainfall, temperature and wind speed were obtained from standard meteorological stations located at/near the study sites. Soil samples and yield data were also obtained in each season. The study revealed that disease incidence; severity and groundnut yields were significantly affected by season, location and genotype. The same applied to their three way interactions. Levels of disease infection were found to be majorly influenced by rainfall and wind speed. Disease incidence and severity were generally higher in conditions with less rainfall and low wind speeds. The Pearson's two tailed correlation between total rainfall and disease incidence for all trial sites was negative and highly significant (r = −0.280, P ≤ 0.01). The same was true for wind speed and disease incidence (r = −0.476, P ≤ 0.01). However, there was no conclusive trend between temperature and disease incidence with the Pearson's two tailed correlation showing significantly positive and negative trends depending on location. },

	Abstract = {We compared gene expression in Norway spruce secondary phloem (bark) and developing xylem (sapwood) in response to the necrotrophic pathogen Heterobasidion parviporum, wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJ). The pathogen induced systemic and local up-regulation of PaPX3, PaPX2 and PaChi4 in both bark and sapwood that returned to constitutive levels as the plants recovered from the infection, whereas the local responses to MeJ were similar in both tissues but was longer lasting for PaPX3 and PaChi4. Genes involved in lignin biosynthesis (PaPAL1, PaPAL2, PaC4H3/5 and PaHCT1) were up-regulated locally in the bark in response to pathogen and wounding whereas MeJ induced a similar but stronger local response. The ethylene biosynthesis related transcripts PaACO and PaACS did not increase in response to MeJ treatment or the pathogen, however it increased both locally and systemically as a response to wounding in the sapwood. These results demonstrate that the local and systemic host responses to pathogen infection and wounding largely correspond and reveal striking similarities between the local response to a necrotroph, wounding and MeJ treatment in both bark and living wood. },

	Abstract = {Sulfated laminarin (PS3) has previously been shown to induce resistance of grapevine leaves against the oomycete Plasmopara viticola, the causal agent of grape downy mildew. Here, we observed that the level of PS3-induced resistance (PS3-IR) was higher in the adult leaf (in position P3) than in the younger, not fully expanded leaf (in position P1, located above P3). By investigating grapevine defense reactions upon \{PS3\} treatment and inoculation, we found that the production of H2O2, of phytoalexins, and the deposition of phenolics were more abundant in \{P3\} than in \{P1\} leaves. In addition, \{PS3\} significantly reduced stomatal colonization by zoospores only in \{P3\} leaves. Thus, the capacity of an adult leaf to express a higher level of defense reactions during PS3-IR may partly explain why it exhibits a more elevated resistance when compared to a young leaf, still in growth. These findings have likely practical consequences in induced resistance application. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Ubiquitin (Ub), a 76-amino acid protein, functions as a tag that can be attached to substrates for selected degradation in a Ub/26S proteasome system (UPS). In this paper, effects of the Ub gene TaUb2 from wheat expressed in tobacco plants are reported. Three TaUb2-overexpressing transgenic tobacco lines were used to study the functions of Ub in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain \{DC3000\} (Pst DC3000). After infection with Pst DC3000, wild-type (WT) plants displayed more severe disease symptoms than transgenic plants. We observed a smaller stomatal aperture, slower water loss and less leaf wilt in transgenic plants after Pst \{DC3000\} infection compared to \{WT\} plants. After Pst \{DC3000\} treatment, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde levels were lower and were consistent with the higher antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) that were observed in the transgenic plants compared with the \{WT\} plants; however, there was no significant difference in these parameters between the transgenic plants and \{WT\} before Pst \{DC3000\} treatment. At the same time, a hypersensitive response (HR) was also observed in transgenic plants when infected by Pst DC3000, which may be induced by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript expressions of some pathogenesis-related genes (PR) in transgenic plants were obviously higher than those in \{WT\} plants after Pst \{DC3000\} treatment. These results suggest that Ub is involved in plant disease resistance. Stomatal aperture, antioxidant capacity and ROS-burst-induced disease resistance may be important mechanisms underlying enhanced disease resistance in transgenic tobacco with overexpression of TaUb2. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Constitutive and induced polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) were purified and characterized from chickpea \{ICCV10\} genotype, treated with salicylic acid. PPO-I was purified to 124-fold with 1.3% yield, while PPO-II was purified to 142-fold with a yield of 1.2%. The molecular mass of each isozyme was estimated to be 81 and 64 kDa for PPO-I and PPO-II, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature for both isozymes was pH 7.0 and 25 $\,^{\circ}$C, respectively. Using catechol as a substrate, Km for PPO-I and PPO-II were 5 mM and 2.5 mM, respectively, while Vmax for PPO-I and PPO-II were 250 U and 500 U, respectively. In addition, induced PPO-II was found to possess laccase activity. Salicylic acid (1--10 μM) had no effect on PPO-I activity, whereas PPO-II/laccase activity increased by 20%. Differential inhibition of both the enzymes was observed by kojic acid, \{CTAB\} and sodium azide. Among the various \{PPO\} inhibitors tested, l-ascorbic acid, citric acid, l-cysteine, and sodium bisulphite were found to be potent inhibitors of PPO-II but not PPO-I. PPO-I is a constitutive isozyme, whereas PPO-II is a novel bifunctional isozyme associated with laccase activity and induced upon infection with Foc or treatment with SA. The role of these isozymes is discussed in the context of chickpea infected with Foc. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In plants, green fluorescent protein (GFP) has become a preferred molecular marker for gene expression and cellular localization, and plant viral vectors are valuable tools for heterologous gene expression. Some plant viruses have been used for expression of GFP, and the activities of these viruses are barely affected by the extra \{GFP\} gene. In contrast, the packaging and the length of Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome is strictly limited when foreign genes are inserted into the coding sequences of \{TCV\} genome. In this report, we removed the silencing suppressor p38 from TCV, and constructed \{GFP\} derivatives of TCV. Then the resulting \{TCV\} mutants were used to infect Arabidopsis plants containing mutations in key silencing pathway genes, including triple dcl2/dcl3/dcl4, dcl2, dcl4 and ago mutant plants. Our results demonstrate that the activity of \{TCV\} is affected by nonviral \{GFP\} insert in Arabidopsis plants, and \{RNA\} silencing appears not play an important role. \{AGOs\} appear to be more efficient at slicing \{RNAs\} of viral origin, especially \{AGO2\} and AGO7. Although the viral suppressors of \{RNA\} silencing (VSRs) \{P19\} and 2b can enhance the accumulation of viral RNAs, neither \{P19\} nor 2b can significantly increase the expression of \{TCV\} mutants with nonviral genes. \{TCV\} is an example of an \{RNA\} virus that is recalcitrant to add nonviral gene sequences. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A \{RIL\} population of jute was developed by crossing one resistant accession \{CIM\} 036 and a susceptible variety \{JRC\} 412. Two cDNA libraries were constructed using pool of mRNA from healthy as well as infected seedlings from all the 177 \{RIL\} lines. A significant number of defense genes involved in the defense-response were identified viz. cell wall biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, jasmonic acid (JA), abscissic acid (ABA), hormone signaling, hypersensitive response (HR) and programmed cell death (PCD) pathways. Furthermore, microRNA analysis revealed that Trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) negatively regulate these target transcripts and are characterized by siRNAs spaced in 21-nucleotide (nt) ``phased'' intervals. We identified highly abundant 22-nt miRNA families that target conserved domains in these SA/JA/ABA precursors and trigger the production of trans-acting siRNAs. \{SA\} and \{JA1\} transcripts were found to be cleaved by these 22-nt miRNA generating phasiRNA, suggesting silencing pathogenicity pathway of Macrophomina phaseolina. Gene function annotation was studied in jute-M. phaseolina interaction in each of the 177 lines of a \{RIL\} population. tasiRNA based \{SAR\} regulation demonstrated master regulator of a large gene family. It is the first report of studying resistance mechanism in jute against M. phaseolina in a \{RIL\} population through transcript and miRNA analysis. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae represents notorious vascular wilt pathogens and has very broad host range. Since the disease caused by V. dahliae relies on its virulence as well as the amount of microsclerotia in the soil, large effort has been taken to screen for genes functional in pathogenicity and microsclerotial formation. So far \{DNA\} glycosylase has not been reported for functionality in pathogenesis of any bacteria, fungi or oomycetes. Here, we described for the first time, a uracil-DNA glycosylase VdUDG, which was found to be involved in not only pathogenicity but also microsclerotial formation based on screening of T-DNA insertion library. Transcription analysis of wild type strain and VdUDG gene knock-out mutants suggested that VdUDG regulates transcription of a series of genes involved in microsclerotial formation and pathogenesis of V. dahliae. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Valsa canker caused by the necrotrophic ascomycete Valsa mali is a destructive disease on apple in eastern Asia. To date, the disease still cannot be effectively controlled, mainly because V. mali extensively penetrates into the phloem and xylem and limited information about the resistance mechanism is available. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of V. mali-infected apple (Malus x domestica) to identify genes associated with V. mali induced resistance responses. Totally, 2713 apple genes were significantly up-regulated upon V. mali infection. Functional enrichment analysis showed that resistance responses were significantly over-represented in up-regulated genes, including chitin, hormone and cell death responses. Two chitin-elicitor receptors, \{MDP0000136494\} and MDP0000169047, probably were the key chitin receptors responded to V. mali-infection. Jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling were revealed to be the primary phytohormone pathways of apple against V. mali. In addition, 11 cytochrome \{P450\} genes likely to be involved in the xenobiotics biodegradation or phytoalexins biosynthesis were identified. This new information provides insights into the resistance responses against V. mali. Functional verification of these genes identified here will facilitate understanding the resistance mechanism of apple and establishing new effective disease arrangement strategies. },

	Abstract = {In commercial apple orchards in southern Brazil, it is common to avoid hail damage by covering the trees with nets. This study was carried out to assess the effects of both black and white hail netting on the temporal dynamics of Glomerella Leaf Spot disease (GLS) in a commercial `Royal Gala' apple orchard in a high-altitude region of southern Brazil during two growing seasons (2003/2004 and 2004/2005). Apple trees on \{M9\} rootstock, trained to a slender spindle and with a spacing of 5.5 m × 3 m, were left uncovered (control) or covered with black or white hail netting. The incidence and severity of \{GLS\} were quantified biweekly from October to February by evaluating 100 leaves distributed randomly on four medium-height branches per plant on each 12 replications per treatment. Disease progress curves were constructed from the data and the epidemics were compared by using four epidemiological measures: the beginning of symptom appearance (BSA), the time to reach the maximum disease intensity (TRMDI), the maximum value of disease severity (Ymax), and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). The highest intensity of \{GLS\} was observed in the plants under the black hail netting. Significant reductions in \{BSA\} and \{TRMDI\} and significant increases in Ymax and \{AUDPC\} were found among treatments in both growing seasons. However, no significant differences of \{GLS\} were found between the white hail netting and the control in either growing season. },
