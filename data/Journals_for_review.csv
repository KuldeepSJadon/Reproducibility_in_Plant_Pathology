Studies were conducted to evaluate the yields, and resistance of three commercial strawberry cultivars to crown and root diseases, both in fumigated and non-fumigated field beds, and to determine the responses of eight commercial cultivars to individual pathogens under controlled conditions. In the field, cv. Camino Real showed the greatest fruit yield both in fumigated and non-fumigated beds, and was the most disease-resistant cultivar. Each cultivar had a greater fruit yield and a lower amount of plant decline in fumigated beds, compared with non-fumigated beds. Both for fumigated and non-fumigated beds, the amount of plant decline increased from August to November, particularly in non-fumigated beds. Under controlled conditions, cv. Festival was most resistant and cv. Camarosa most susceptible to wilt-causing Fusarium oxysporum. Against binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A, Cylindrocarpon destructans and Phoma exigua, cv. Festival was most resistant and cv. Aromas most susceptible. Cultivar Camino Real was the most resistant to Gnomonia fructicola and Phytophthora cactorum and cv. Festival most resistant to Pythium ultimum. Against Macrophomina phaseolina, cv. Albion was the most resistant with cv. Camarosa the most susceptible. Cultivar Camarosa, the most widely grown cultivar in W.A., was most susceptible to F. oxysporum, while cv. Camino Real was resistant to F. oxysporum both in the field and the controlled environment conditions. Cultivar Festival is the most resistant cultivar to F. oxysporum and a range of different pathogens. The Australian bred cv. Juliette was as susceptible as cv. Camarosa to F. oxysporum, but relatively resistant to binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A. This is the first study, not only to define the relative yield potentials of different cultivars in a situation where crown and root disease prevails in the field, but also to demonstrate differential resistance of current cultivars to specific pathogens associated with crown and root disease in W.A. For the first time, growers can now make informed choices about the cultivars they can deploy to minimise losses caused by diseases.","2012","2017-04-11 08:32:45","2017-04-11 08:32:45","","","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: PM9746  bibtex[bdsk-url-1=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/pm/article/view/9746]","","","","binucleate Rhizoctonia; Fragaria x ananassa; fumigation; Fusarium oxysporum; plant decline","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disease has also been reported from India, Hungary, Spain and Portugal. The pathogen survives for long periods in soil. Late wilt is currently controlled using maize varieties with reduced sensitivity, but virulent variants of the fungus may threaten these varieties. Common disease symptoms have been documented over 20 years in Upper Galilee (northern Israel), particularly the Hula Valley. Recently, prevalence of the disease has increased. This is the first confirmed report of the direct and primary cause of the disease in Israel. Isolates of the pathogen obtained from wilting maize plants were morphologically identical to those of strains found in Egypt and India. We modified a molecular method as a diagnostic assay of disease progress in an infested field in northern Israel. The assay identified the pathogen 50 d after seeding, before the emergence of disease symptoms, both in susceptible and partially resistant host plants. DNA assessment was consistent with the disease progress in a susceptible maize variety, and the pathogen also spread in partially resistant plants that showed no symptoms. Seeds of apparently healthy, partially resistant plants may therefore also spread the disease. A modified molecular method presented here is a preliminary step in developing a seed health assay.","2012","2017-04-11 08:32:45","2017-04-11 08:32:45","","","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: PM10824  bibtex[bdsk-url-1=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/pm/article/view/10824]","","","","fungal; Harpophora maydis; late wilt; maize; molecular diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, the development of maize genotypes with reduced mycotoxin accumulation in grain is of major importance. In order to find maize germplasm sources of resistance to Fusarium ear rot, 34 Italian and six public inbred lines were evaluated by means of artificial inoculation in field experiments during 2009 and 2010. Relationships between ear rot and fumonisin concentration in the ears were investigated. Primary ears were challenged with a mixture of two Fusarium verticillioides isolates from Northern Italy, through kernel inoculation, and ear rot severity was assessed.The average number of visibly infected kernels per ear, after inoculation, ranged from 2 to 68 in 2009 and from 0 to 120 in 2010. Fumonisin concentrations in the inoculated ears were greater than in the experimental controls for both years. Variability was found between the inbred lines: fumonisin accumulation ranged from 0.56 to 240.83 mg kg-1 in 2009 and from 1.09 to 190.60 mg kg-1 in 2010. In both years, six inbred lines showed high fumonisin content (≥100 mg kg-1), while the other genotypes were almost equally split into two groups, low (≤10 mg kg-1) and medium (from 11 to 100 mg kg-1) fumonisin content. The number of infected kernels after artificial inoculation correlated with fumonisin concentration both in 2009 (r = 0.94; P≤0.01) and 2010 (r = 0.67; P≤0.01). Additionally, the percentage of internally infected kernels correlated positively with fumonisin concentration (r = 0.37; P≤0.01) and with the number of infected kernels (r = 0.29; P≤0.05). This research has demonstrated that Italian maize germplasm is a valid source of resistance to Fusarium ear rot. Furthermore, there is a strong association of visible Fusarium symptoms with fumonisin concentration, suggesting that selection in maize for reduced visible moulds should reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination.","2014","2017-04-11 08:32:45","2017-04-11 08:32:45","","","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: PM11776  bibtex[bdsk-url-1=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/pm/article/view/11776]","","","","artificial inoculation; fungal pathogen; genetic variability; mycotoxin; Zea mays L..","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L. Mostert, W. Gams  Crous was previously known mainly as a human pathogen. However, more recently this fungus has been isolated from wood tissue of grapevines that show Petri and esca disease symptoms in California (USA) and South Africa. During an assessment carried out in southern Italy, the abundant presence of this fungus was demonstrated by morphological, cultural and molecular means. Pleurostomophora richardsiae was isolated from sub-cortical wood patches and streaking of trunks and cordons of grapevine cultivars that showed decline and dieback symptoms. To understand its putative pathogenic role, pathogenicity tests were conducted in greenhouse experiments, where young grapevine plants of two cultivars were artificially inoculated with two isolates each of Pl. richardsiae, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Phaeoacremonium aleophilum. Within 130 d, all three fungi produced brown streaking in both grapevine cultivars. The L. theobromae and Pl. richardsiae isolates were the most aggressive. Although the Pm. aleophilum isolates were pathogenic, they induced less severe wood streaking than the other two fungi. Therefore, Pl. richardsiae is considered a fungal pathogen of grapevine. All three fungal species were re-isolated from discolored tissue of all inoculated shoots, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates.","2015","2017-04-11 08:32:45","2017-04-11 08:32:45","","","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: PM15257  bibtex[bdsk-url-1=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/pm/article/view/15257]","","","","pathogenicity; phylogeny; Vitis vinifera; wood browning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nineteen R. vitis strains presented a number of anomalous biochemical and physiological characters. PCR and opine-specific primers revealed the presence of octopine/cucumopine-type plasmid in 82 R. vitis strains, nopaline-type plasmids in 18 strains and vitopine-type plasmids in three strains. Clonal relationship of strains was determined using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis following digestion of genomic DNA with the restriction endonuclease PmeI.

Growth chamber experiments using Petri dishes revealed that rhizobia infection on chickpea roots reduced broomrape seed germination, and restricted the broomrape attachment to host roots while retarding tubercle formation and development by the parasite. In pot experiments, chickpea roots inoculated with rhizobia reduced the total number of broomrape by up to 90%. Broomrape necrosis was observed both before and after parasite attachment to inoculated chickpea roots in Petri dishes and pot experiments. Reduction in infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of the defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POX). Increased levels of phenolics were recorded in the roots of rhizobia-inoculated plants grown in the presence of broomrape. The results suggest that rhizobia could be used for protection of chickpea against O. foetida.","2016","2017-04-11 08:32:45","2017-04-11 08:32:45","","","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: PM16338  bibtex[bdsk-url-1=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/pm/article/view/16338]","","","","biocontrol; defense related enzymes; legume crops; phenolic content","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

El objetivo del presente trabajo fue desarrollar un método de inoculación con teliosporas del hongo Sporisorium reilianum f. sp. zeae en semillas de máiz que resulte en un alto y consistente porcentaje de infección de plántulas, e implementarlo en programas de selección de germoplasma resistente a este patógeno. Semillas de máiz susceptible a la enfermedad se inocularon con diferentes métodos que permitieron el contacto entre patógeno y hospedante (teliosporas-semilla). Las semillas inoculadas se sembraron en macetas con suelo estéril en condiciones de 25 ºC y fotopeŕiodo de 12 h luz. A 25 d después de la siembra se cuantificó el número de plántulas infectadas mediante la observación de micelio en el mesocotilo. Se determinó que 7 semillas inoculadas con una suspensión de 1.7 x 10 -1 teliosporas mL y 1% de carboximetilcelulosa de sodio, produjeron 93.3 y 96.6% de infección en plántulas de máiz susceptible del criollo Blanco de Toluca y del h́ibrido AS- 910, respectivamente. En plántulas infectadas se observó micelio intracelular en el parénquima del mesocotilo sin provocar śintomas visibles, en plantas adultas se presentó la formación de soros en la panoja y mazorca. La identidad del micelio presente en el mesocotilo se confirmó mediante la técnica de PCR usando los iniciadores espećificos SR1 y SR2.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:45","2017-04-11 08:32:45","","80-90","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Quezada-Salinas2013  bibtex[mendeley-groups=Reproducible Research]","","","","adicionales; carbón de la espiga; carboximetilcelulosa; el carbón de la; espiga del máiz; por; sin; sp; sphacelotheca; sporisorium reilianum f; teliosporas; zeae; zea mays; zea mays l","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mex. Fitopatol.","","0185-3309","","","Resumen. La malformación es una de las enfermedades más importantes del mango en el ámbito mundial. Varias especies de Fusarium han sido identificadas como agentes causales de esta enfermedad. Recientemente, una nueva especie, F. mexicanum, fue descrita causando malformación en huertas de mango de la región centro occidente de México; sin embargo, esta especie no ha sido detectada en áreas productoras del Golfo de México. Durante los últimos años, se ha presentado un incremento en las huertas de mango que presentan malformación en Jalisco, un estado localizado al norte del área donde F. mexicanum ha sido detectado. El objetivo de este trabajo fue identificar el patógeno causante de la malformación floral y vegetativa en Jalisco. Análisis morfológico y genético de los genes ß tubulina, EF-1á, e histona H3, mostró que todos los aislados estudiados fueron F. mexicanum. Se confirmó que este patógeno es la especie principal causante de la malformación del mango en los estados localizados en la región del Paćifico central. Análisis filogenéticos mostraron que F. mexicanum pudiera estar presente como poblaciones clonales cuya dispersión pudo haber ocurrido por medio de la comercialización de plantas de vivero contaminadas. F. mangiferae, F. sterilihyphosum y tipo F. subglutinans, especies causantes de la malformación en otros páises, no fueron detectadas en este estudio.

Nineteen M. truncatula ecotypes were evaluated for disease susceptibility to M. pinodes strain OMP-1, using detached leaves inoculated with a pycnospore suspension. Inoculation of ecotype R108-1 with the pycnospores allowed direct penetration into the host's epidermal cells, eventually causing leaf spots. Since pycnidia formed abundantly in infected tissues by 3 days post inoculation, M. pinodes is considered to have completed its infection cycle as on a natural host plant. Expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)-, chalcone synthase (CHS)- and isoflavone reductase (IFR) mRNAs as well as subsequent accumulation of a major phytoalexin, medicarpin, was induced in ecotype R108-1 with an elicitor preparation from M. pinodes, whereas this phytoalexin response was markedly attenuated by supprescins from the same fungus. A transcriptional study of a salicylic acid (SA)-regulated gene encoding pathogenesis-related protein 10-1 (PR10-1) indicated that the suppressor likely interferes with the signal transduction process leading to inducible defenses in M. truncatula. Indeed, the suppressor rendered the host tissues (ecotype R108-1) susceptible to unrelated nonpathogenic fungi, probably through targeting ATPase activity of the host cells. Accordingly, the resistant and susceptible response of pea can be recapitulated in M. truncatula. This model pathosystem thus will allow us to verify the molecular basis underlying the fungal suppressor-mediated plant susceptibility.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:46","2017-04-11 08:32:46","","1-11","","1","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Toyoda2013  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-012-0405-7]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, a scattered pattern of potentially or apparently diseased plants caused by primary inoculum from residual plants in the soil emerged with time.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:46","2017-04-11 08:32:46","","46-50","","1","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Kawaguchi2013  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-012-0416-4]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nutrient and water uptake are substantially reduced in infested plants, resulting into altered physiological processes and reduced plant growth. The effect of nematode infestation on the morphological changes of roots and subsequent physiological plant responses of infested tomatoes with the RKN Meloidogyne ethiopica was studied in a pot experiment. Plants were infested with two inoculum densities (10 or 50 eggs per cm3 substrate) and its effect was evaluated 74 and 102 days post inoculation (DPI). Morphological changes and root growth was determined by analysing scanned images of the whole root system. Nematode infestation reduced the portion of fine roots and increased that of coarse roots due to gall formation. Fine roots of non-infested control plants represented around 51% of the area of the whole root system at 74 and 102 DPI. In comparison to controls, plants inoculated with low and high nematode density had 2.1 and 3.2-times lower surface area of fine roots at 102 DPI. Root analyses revealed that plants had a very limited ability to mitigate the effects of the root-knot nematodes infestation by altering root growth. Root galls had a major influence on the hydraulic conductivity of the root system, which was significantly reduced. The low leaf water potential of infested plants coincided with decreased stomatal conductivity, transpiration and photosynthesis. The latter two were reduced by 60--70% when compared to non-infested control plants.","2012","2017-04-11 08:32:46","2017-04-11 08:32:46","","49-57","","1","132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Strajnar2012  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-011-9847-6]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the MAT locus from 10 California isolates that cause atypical blotch symptoms on barley. Analysis of the full-length nucleotide sequences of one MAT1-1 (1,993 bp) and nine MAT1-2 (2,149 or 2,161 bp) idiomorphs revealed high (98--99 %) similarity to those of Ptt isolates. However, distinct SNP patterns were identified in the newly cloned MAT idiomorphs. Two new MAT1-2-specific SNPs were found to be conserved in one Australia and eight California isolates that all cause similar atypical blotch symptoms. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all 10 California isolates form a separate branch (or clade) within the Ptt group, except for one that appears to be ancestral to both Ptt and Ptm. PCR primers designed based on the identified SNP patterns were used successfully to differentiate each atypical isolate from highly virulent forms. This study extends our previous work and, taken together, the results demonstrate that the genetic variation at the MAT locus correlates with variation in the form-specific disease phenotype, and that MAT-specific SNPs can serve as reliable and convenient markers for subspecies level differentiation in P. teres, an economically important plant-pathogenic ascomycete ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_nucleotide_polymorphism ).","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:46","2017-04-11 08:32:46","","49-65","","1","135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Lu2013  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-012-0064-8]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disease severity and kernel fumonisin accumulation were measured after inoculation with F. verticillioides and related to contents of pericarp phenylpropanoids in field trials conducted during 2 years. Grain fumonisin concentrations were highly dependant on disease severity of the genotypes (rthinspace=thinspace0.88). A detailed analysis of pericarp phenylpropanoids indicated the presence of trans-ferulic acid (tFA), cis-ferulic acid (cFA), p-coumaric acid (pCA), and five diferulates (DFAs). The most prominent diferulates were 8,5textasciiacutex-diferulic acid benzofuram form (8,5textasciiacutex-DFAbz), followed by 8,5textasciiacutex-DFA and 8,8textasciiacutex-DFA. Except for cFA, the most resistant genotypes exhibited high levels of phenylpropanoids which were related to low levels of disease severity and grain fumonisin concentration (−0.61 > rthinspace>thinspace−0.90). A stepwise regression analysis revealed that total diferulates was the best explanatory parameter for variability of disease severity (r 2thinspace=thinspace0.71). Grain fumonisin concentration was well depicted by contents of total diferulates, 8,5textasciiacutexDFAbz and pCA (r 2thinspace=thinspace0.82). Our findings suggest that high level of phenylpropanoids in the kernel pericarp is a trait associated to less disease severity and fumonisin accumulation caused by F. verticillioides.

Barrage formation was very frequent on a defined complete agar medium within V. dahliae and between species of the genus. However, it was not correlated with the classification of V. dahliae isolates into Vegetative Compatibility Groups (VCGs) (based on the standard method using complementary nit mutants), as it was recorded at high frequencies both within and between V. dahliae VCGs. The high overall frequency of barrage formation demonstrated the presence of a higher level of mycelial incompatibility in V. dahliae than heterokaryon incompatibility assessed by forcing complementary nit mutants to form heterokaryons under selective conditions.

This contrasts with earlier reports of anthracnose occurring on bell pepper primarily as a ripe-rot disease of mature, colored pepper fruit caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Management of anthracnose on green bell pepper fruit using fungicides and a commercial inducer of systemic acquired resistance, acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), was evaluated during three seasons. In two of the three trials, all the fungicides tested including azoxystrobin, fludioxonil + cyprodinil, mancozeb, famoxadone + cymoxanil, copper hydroxide, and ASM significantly increased the number of marketable fruit compared with control plants. These trials identified fungicides that could contribute to a successful pest management program on pepper for controlling anthracnose caused by C. acutatum. The cross-infectivity potential of C. acutatum was investigated on tomato and strawberry by in vitro and field inoculation. Anthracnose lesions formed readily on wound-inoculated detached fruits of all hosts in in vitro assays. Under field conditions, after inoculation, anthracnose lesions occurred on pepper fruit but no lesions of anthracnose were found on either ripe or unripe tomato or strawberry fruit in adjacent plots.","2014","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","31-39","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Harp2014  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-013-0334-9]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ecological interactions between Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) and its aphid vector, Rhopalosiphum padi, have been investigated extensively, but the vector's behavior in more complex scenarios has yet to be examined. We assessed olfactory response and performance of R. padi to wheat singly and doubly infected by the pathogenic fungus Giberella zeae and BYDV. Non-viruliferous aphids preferred odors of BYDV-infected wheat over healthy wheat, as previously reported in the literature, and they were still preferentially attracted to BYDV-infected plant during co-infection. However, around 35% more non-viruliferous aphids chose healthy wheat over G. zeae-infected wheat. Viruliferous aphids did not show any preference to the treatments. BYDV-infected wheat was a superior host than healthy wheat for the aphids whose population increased in 25%. We observed a synergistic effect of the co-infected wheat, which was the best host for aphids, and promoted an elevation of 42% on population growth. Our results indicate that co-infection might be beneficial for virus spread as does not interfere with aphid olfactory preference and provides greater colony growth than in singly infected plants.","2016","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","47-54","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: dosSantos2016  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-015-0493-y]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, short dry heat treatments on basil seeds have been shown to be a valid but complementary seed disinfection method against Fusarium wilt.","2016","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","35-45","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Lopez-Reyes2016  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-016-0504-7]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Del. and on-farm weeds on severity of dry root rot caused by Macrophomina phaseolina in relation to microbial population dynamics, microbial activity and on seed yield of guar was ascertained. In general, during crop growth compost amended plots retained 16 % higher soil moisture than non-amended plots. Populations of total fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes increased in the amended plots during the crop season. The maximum population of total fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria were recorded in A. nilotica, P. juliflora and weeds compost-amended treatments, respectively. Microbial activity was also 26.1 % higher in amended compared to non-amended plots. Amendment of soil with composts resulted in increases in the concentration of micronutrients and significant reduction in plant mortality due to dry root rot. Beneficial effects of composts were also discernible in yield promotion where 40 % increase in the seed yield was recorded in P. juliflora compost-amended plots. These results suggests that in arid regions of India, certain on-farm wastes can be effectively utilized for managing Macrophomina induced diseases besides enhancing crop productivity.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","9-16","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Bareja2013  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-012-0157-z]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the monitoring effort in Australia and elsewhere is driven by existing understanding of Puccinia psidii sensu lato (guava rust), because U. rangelii is part of the guava rust complex. Bioclimatic analyses for guava rust in Australia indicate highest risk along the eastern coast, from northern Queensland to the south coast of NSW. These analyses rely on native and invaded range records for Puccinia psidii sensu lato. However, models that are instead fitted to records representing U. rangelii emphasise different risk areas, with less focus on northern coastal Queensland and new predictions into NSW tablelands and north-eastern Victoria. These differences have important implications for biosecurity containment and monitoring efforts. Here we use this example as a case study to explore the implications of taxonomic uncertainty for predictions of the potential distribution of a species of biosecurity concern in Australia. The important message is that the different patterns implied by different taxonomic assumptions may have very different management implications and taxonomic uncertainty should be evaluated alongside other sources of uncertainty. We could find no published example where taxonomic uncertainty was evaluated in biosecurity planning, despite the fact that taxonomic uncertainties are common. We outline how to model such uncertainties and discuss methods for exploring them and their impacts on predicted distributions.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","43-51","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Elith2013  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-012-0178-7]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall results showed that all isolates produced necrotic lesions on all varieties but susceptibility varied significantly (Pthinspace<thinspace0.001) with 5C and SO4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions. Pathogenicity also varied significantly (Pthinspace<thinspace0.001) between species with N. parvum being the most virulent among three species tested. This study has further shown that different isolates of the three species have different levels of virulence providing evidence that these pathogens are genetically diverse. These results have significant implications for the New Zealand grapevine industry as the use of resistant varieties is not a possible option at present since none of the common varieties are resistant to these pathogens.","2014","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","25-31","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Billones-Baaijens2014  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-013-0228-9]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brassica oleracea seedlings were sown directly into 10 mL centrifuge tubes containing half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution. Seedlings were fastened in 1 cm thick foam in the tube top and tubes were wrapped with black tape to block light and prevent algal growth. Maximal root hair infection was observed under conditions of pH 5.5, temperature of 20 to 25 °C, and an inoculation concentration of 1thinspace×thinspace107 spores/mL. Infection efficiency was obviously higher in fresh nutrient. Under optimum infection conditions, plasmodia were found in the root hair 4 days after inoculation (DAI), with some undergoing cleavage and developing into round zoosporangia 3 days later. At ten DAI, the number of root hairs containing zoosporangia per root reached 208, and the cytoplasm within the zoosporangia began to cleave and form incipient zoospores. Most zoosporangia released the zoospores and became diaphanous at ten DAI. Root hairs became swollen during the experimental trial and small galls appeared clearly on the root at 20 DAI. In addition, sectioned specimens showed that some cortical cells contained resting spores. We sequentially tested the germination of the resting spores in tubes from 1 to 11 DAI and the temporal dynamics of germination corresponding to the infection.

However, the variability in reproduction and damaging effects observed among P. brachyurus populations could limit the efficacy and long lasting effect of nematode control practices. Twelve populations of P. brachyurus from different geographical areas of Brazil were analyzed morphologically and molecularly. The morphological and morphometric characters of the populations studied were variable, but fitted those of P. brachyurus. Assemblages of populations with different host preferences and reproductive capabilities were revealed by PCA of these populations using selected morphological characters. Phylogenetic analysis using ITS-rDNA sequences distinguished statistically supported groups of sequences that matched those of other populations of P. brachyurus deposited in the GenBank, confirming the identity of populations here studied. Intraspecific sequence diversity was observed among the populations. These variant sequences suggest the presence of microheterogeneity between ITS-1 copies in individuals. The findings of this study did not provide evidence of cryptic species in the P. brachyurus populations studied. The variability within and among populations of P. brachyurus observed in this work must be taken into consideration in breeding programs for resistance to this nematode.","2015","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","102-110","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Machado2015  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-015-0013-0]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We constructed mutants through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and found that mutant T806 showed a significant decline in pathogenicity on maize leaves and produced no detectable M5HF2C. Although the tagged gene (Clt-1) has been cloned and demonstrated to be closely association with M5HF2C production and pathogenicity, we expected hypothesized that other proteins might also be related to toxin production. Therefore we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to profile T806, and found that there were two up-regulated and six missing proteins in T806 compared to C. lunata wild-type CX-3. These results indicated that these proteins were associated with signal transduction, protein synthesis, secondary metabolism and pathogenicity. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of five selected genes showed a correlation between low gene expression and detection of the corresponding proteins. Of these, dihydropteroate (DHFA) synthase may be more likely involved in M5HF2C biosynthesis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that DHFA synthase consists of 469 amino acids, which is clustered into one branch with dothideomycete DHFA synthase homolologs in a phylogenetic tree. Further study on the exact role of the DHFA synthase gene is underway.","2015","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","119-126","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Gao2015  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-015-0015-y]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, efficient inoculation methods for bacterial wilt on eucalypt are scarce and have low replicability. In this work, we developed an effective protocol for inoculation of R. solanacearum, which was subsequently validated on different eucalypt clones. Three methods were tested: (i) soil infestation with bacterial cell suspension; (ii) immersion of wounded roots in the bacterial cell suspension; and (iii) injection of bacterial cell suspension in the base of the stem. The injection method proved to be the most efficient for inoculating eucalypt with R. solanacearum. Differentiation between resistant and susceptible clones was observed 30 days after inoculation in independent assays. Base stem inoculation of 21 eucalypt clones showed that four clones, classified as resistant, did not exhibit wilt symptoms or bacterial ooze at the end of the experiment. Although no wilting symptoms were observed, four other clones were considered susceptible because at least one plant showed bacterial ooze from the inoculated tissue. The remaining 13 clones were highly susceptible, presenting typical wilt symptoms and bacterial ooze.","2016","2017-04-11 08:32:47","2017-04-11 08:32:47","","42-47","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Fonseca2016  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-015-0056-2]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This disease is specific to green berries and leads to 60--80% harvest losses under conditions conducive to the development of the pathogen. Agricultural practices, combined with chemical control involving 8--12 annual fungicide applications, are known to be very effective against CBD, especially in high altitude regions (gt;1600 m) where the most damaged coffee farms are found. Temperatures and rainfall may be key factors in the development of {CBD} epidemics. Therefore, an epidemiological study was conducted on smallholding coffee farms in Cameroon, to assess the dependence of disease development on variations in these climatic factors. Cross-correlations between disease severity and climatic parameters recorded weekly were estimated over two successive years (2004--2005), revealing a significant increase in disease severity in line with decreasing temperatures (minimum or maximum). They also indicated a large variation in disease severity depending on the number of raining days during berry growth. However, no significant correlation was found with the quantity of rainfall over the two years of observations. Thus, temperatures and rainfall distribution appear to be the key climatic parameters that favor the development of {CBD} epidemics. These results suggest that temperature and rainfall parameters might be very useful for establishing predictive models to optimize effective {CBB} control in areas with a high disease incidence.","2012","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","125 - 131","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: MouenBedimo2012125  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219411003024;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2011.09.010]","","","","analysis; series; Time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among 16 treatments, systemic fungicides were found to be superior to biocontrol agents in controlling the disease whereas the maximum green leaf yield was significantly increased in those applied with biocontrol agents. On the whole, Streptomyces sannanensis offered the maximum yield of 3998 kg ha−1 made tea followed by Trichoderma harzianum (3884 kg ha−1 made tea). Between the two different carrier materials evaluated for the application of biocontrol agents, vermicompost-based bioformulation showed better efficacy than talc-based formulation. Of the three (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) groups of biocontrol agents, S. sannanensis was better than Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma atroviride belonging to bacterial and fungal antagonists; respectively in terms of disease protection and increasing yield potential. Similarly, the biometric, physiological and biochemical parameters were also increased in plants greatly after imposing various treatments. Plucking surface of the bush, number of plucking points per unit area, internodal length, leaf moisture and dry matter contents were found higher in plots applied with biocontrol agents than those treated with fungicides. Almost all of the tea quality parameters such as total liquor colour, thearubigins, theaflavins, highly polymerized substance and caffeine were significantly improved in biocontrol treated plants. Theaflavin and thearubigin contents were increased in the range of 9.00--9.57% and 1.27--1.54% respectively in vermin based treatment. Similarly the amount of caffeine content (3.66--4.08%) and flavour index (4.18--5.31%) were considerably enhanced.","2012","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","111 - 118","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Gnanamangai2012111  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219411003231;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2011.10.001]","","","","quality; Tea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, mineral fertilization is widely used to improve the quality and quantity of seeds. In this study, we conducted field experiments to determine the impact of nitrogen fertilization on B. napus pests, their parasitoids and plant diseases. The results showed that N treatment had an impact on the abundance of pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus Fab.) and cabbage seed weevils (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus Marsh.) as well as dark spot disease (Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc.). Since pest abundance was not correlated with the flower and silique numbers, the feeding and oviposition sites, plant smell bouquets were analysed to determine potentially attractive or repellent volatile organic compounds. We detected 19 different compounds among which acetic acid and several lipoxygenase pathway products were emitted at higher levels from N-treated plants. Emission of a few other terpenoid compounds was correlated with the pest abundance in field conditions. Abundance of parasitoids of both pests was related to the host availability rather than to the fertilization treatment. Therefore, we suggest that plant chemical cues play a minor role in localization of hosts in close proximity to parasitoid. Dark spot disease levels decreased with increasing N availability, possibly reflecting enhanced emissions of acetic acid, a known antifungal volatile. This study demonstrates the effects of N fertilization on bud and flower volatile bouquets, which might play a role in B. napus insect pest host selection and in resistance to fungal plant diseases. Further studies are necessary to investigate the behavioural responses of insects to the changed volatile bouquets.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","79 - 88","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Veromann201379  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219412002499;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2012.09.001]","","","","oilseed; rape; Winter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The exploration of environmentally sound practices to control these diseases will help to reduce fungicide application. Effects of rice (Oryza sativa) intercropping with water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) on rice sheath blight and rice blast disease as well as the extracts of different plant parts and root exudates from water chestnut on pathogens of rice sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) and rice blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) were investigated using pot experiments and bioassay tests. The results from pot tests showed that rice-water chestnut intercropping system suppressed sheath blight and blast and improved land equivalent ratio (LER). The results from bioassay tests indicated that extracts and root exudates from water chestnut had significant effects to inhibit the expansion of these pathogens. The scales of these inhibitions were time and concentration dependent. The antifungal activities of the extracts from aboveground parts and pulp of water chestnut were significantly higher than the extracts from other parts and root exudates. The water extracts of aboveground parts showed the highest antifungal activity on both pathogens according to {EC50} values. The antifungal activities of the same extracts from water chestnut on R. solani were significantly higher than on M. oryzae. The result suggests that water chestnut possesses bioactive substances to suppress rice sheath blight disease and rice blast disease. The rice-water chestnut intercropping system can be used as an environment-friendly method for diseases control in rice field.","2013","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","89 - 93","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Qin201389  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219412002578;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2012.09.009]","","","","activity; Antifungal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An on-farm analysis was conducted in Southeast France to assess the efficacy of several cropping systems in simultaneously controlling two major pests: root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and lettuce drop due to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Ten cropping systems resulting from the combinations of three crop sequences and two alternative techniques, solarization and green manure, were assessed during two years. The use of solarization once a year or once every two years limited the occurrence of S. sclerotiorum. Sorghum green manure tended to increase S. sclerotiorum incidence; the effect was positively correlated with green manure duration. Especially when no vegetable was cropped in summer, the green manure crop duration was lengthened and this probably created soil conditions favorable to the development of the fungus. The incidence of root-knot nematodes was largely dependent on crop rotation: a melon crop in summer increased its incidence on the subsequent lettuce crops whereas a summer sorghum cover crop had no effect. The cropping systems that limited Sclerotinia development in soil tended to support the root-knot nematode populations. These results should motivate farmers and advisers to adopt a systemic analysis and take into account the various interactions among inoculum level, soil characteristics, crop rotations, and technical management options for designing sustainable vegetable production systems.","2014","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","7 - 15","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Collange20147  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219413002354;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.002]","","","","nematode; Root-knot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rapid application of quarantine measures by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency significantly changed the use and management of infested fields. The objectives of this study were to assess the evolution of weed populations following these measures and assess their impact on the management of G. rostochiensis. A comparison of weed inventories conducted in 2008 and 2011 on the edges of the affected fields has shown that the composition of the flora had changed considerably. Alarmingly, the presence of Solanaceae that could potentially serve as host plants for the potato cyst nematode increased significantly. The biodiversity index was also significantly affected by this change and decreased by more than 50% between the two years. Interestingly, the lowest biodiversity was observed in one of the few fields where potatoes were grown in 2011 and where an explosion of Solanum sarrachoides was observed. Meanwhile, eight species of nightshade were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of G. rostochiensis. Solanum villosum allowed the greatest rates of reproduction while only a few cysts were produced on Solanum nigrum and Solanum dulcamara. This study has shown that the modifications in weed control regimes associated with the implementation of quarantine procedures could hamper its success by favouring the multiplication of potential pest refuges.","2014","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","21 - 27","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Mimee201421  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219413002366;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.003]","","","","Solanum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is principally transmitted by the groundnut aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch). The disease is known to cause total crop failure in cases where susceptible varieties are used. During any particular season, {GRVD} displays variations in incidence and severity in different agro-ecologies within the country, but the reasons for the varying disease patterns remain unclear. This study was aimed at establishing the factors influencing the occurrence of {GRVD} in Uganda. Trials were established for three seasons in four groundnut growing locations situated in different agro-ecologies in Uganda. Four groundnut genotypes were used as treatments in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Disease progress and aphid populations were assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after planting. Data on environmental factors; particularly rainfall, temperature and wind speed were obtained from standard meteorological stations located at/near the study sites. Soil samples and yield data were also obtained in each season. The study revealed that disease incidence; severity and groundnut yields were significantly affected by season, location and genotype. The same applied to their three way interactions. Levels of disease infection were found to be majorly influenced by rainfall and wind speed. Disease incidence and severity were generally higher in conditions with less rainfall and low wind speeds. The Pearson's two tailed correlation between total rainfall and disease incidence for all trial sites was negative and highly significant (r = −0.280, P ≤ 0.01). The same was true for wind speed and disease incidence (r = −0.476, P ≤ 0.01). However, there was no conclusive trend between temperature and disease incidence with the Pearson's two tailed correlation showing significantly positive and negative trends depending on location.","2016","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","117 - 123","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Mugisa2016117  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261219415301459;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2015.10.019]","","","","speed; Wind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By investigating grapevine defense reactions upon {PS3} treatment and inoculation, we found that the production of H2O2, of phytoalexins, and the deposition of phenolics were more abundant in {P3} than in {P1} leaves. In addition, {PS3} significantly reduced stomatal colonization by zoospores only in {P3} leaves. Thus, the capacity of an adult leaf to express a higher level of defense reactions during PS3-IR may partly explain why it exhibits a more elevated resistance when compared to a young leaf, still in growth.

In this paper, effects of the Ub gene TaUb2 from wheat expressed in tobacco plants are reported. Three TaUb2-overexpressing transgenic tobacco lines were used to study the functions of Ub in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain {DC3000} (Pst DC3000). After infection with Pst DC3000, wild-type (WT) plants displayed more severe disease symptoms than transgenic plants. We observed a smaller stomatal aperture, slower water loss and less leaf wilt in transgenic plants after Pst {DC3000} infection compared to {WT} plants. After Pst {DC3000} treatment, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde levels were lower and were consistent with the higher antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) that were observed in the transgenic plants compared with the {WT} plants; however, there was no significant difference in these parameters between the transgenic plants and {WT} before Pst {DC3000} treatment. At the same time, a hypersensitive response (HR) was also observed in transgenic plants when infected by Pst DC3000, which may be induced by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript expressions of some pathogenesis-related genes (PR) in transgenic plants were obviously higher than those in {WT} plants after Pst {DC3000} treatment. These results suggest that Ub is involved in plant disease resistance. Stomatal aperture, antioxidant capacity and ROS-burst-induced disease resistance may be important mechanisms underlying enhanced disease resistance in transgenic tobacco with overexpression of TaUb2.","2015","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","98 - 104","","","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Zhang201598  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885576515000338;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2015.04.004]","","","","genes; Pathogenesis-related","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular mass of each isozyme was estimated to be 81 and 64 kDa for PPO-I and PPO-II, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature for both isozymes was pH 7.0 and 25  <sup>∘</sup>C, respectively. Using catechol as a substrate, Km for PPO-I and PPO-II were 5 mM and 2.5 mM, respectively, while Vmax for PPO-I and PPO-II were 250 U and 500 U, respectively. In addition, induced PPO-II was found to possess laccase activity. Salicylic acid (1--10 μM) had no effect on PPO-I activity, whereas PPO-II/laccase activity increased by 20%.

To date, the disease still cannot be effectively controlled, mainly because V. mali extensively penetrates into the phloem and xylem and limited information about the resistance mechanism is available. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of V. mali-infected apple (Malus x domestica) to identify genes associated with V. mali induced resistance responses. Totally, 2713 apple genes were significantly up-regulated upon V. mali infection. Functional enrichment analysis showed that resistance responses were significantly over-represented in up-regulated genes, including chitin, hormone and cell death responses. Two chitin-elicitor receptors, {MDP0000136494} and MDP0000169047, probably were the key chitin receptors responded to V. mali-infection. Jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling were revealed to be the primary phytohormone pathways of apple against V. mali. In addition, 11 cytochrome {P450} genes likely to be involved in the xenobiotics biodegradation or phytoalexins biosynthesis were identified. This new information provides insights into the resistance responses against V. mali. Functional verification of these genes identified here will facilitate understanding the resistance mechanism of apple and establishing new effective disease arrangement strategies.","2016","2017-04-11 08:32:49","2017-04-11 08:32:49","","85 - 92","","","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","bibtex: Yin201685  bibtex[date-added=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;date-modified=2017-04-11 08:23:39 +0000;bdsk-url-1=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885576516300042;bdsk-url-2=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2016.01.004]","","","","acid; Jasmonic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
