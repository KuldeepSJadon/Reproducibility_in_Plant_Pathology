## Key for data collection

This vignette documents the fields and values found in the
"article_evaluations" sheet in the "article_notes" Google Sheets
workbook,
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19gXobV4oPZeWZiQJAPNIrmqpfGQtpapXWcSxaXRw1-M/edit#gid=1699540381

### Autogenerated values

In the reproducibility score there are two parts, one part is automatically
generated, as much as possible, using the article DOI to retrieve the reference.

The articles' DOIs are looked up manually by Adam and assigned in the
"[article_notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YrIiQ3OBNjCHMlalkMi1yy8dy4hnj5dnR4PSTj7lDR4/edit#gid=0)" sheet in the googlesheets document, `doi`.

Nik has provided the five-year impact factor, `IF_5year`.

Other items including `journal`, `year`, and `contains_page` are auto-generated by the ["Assigning Articles"](https://github.com/phytopathology/Reproducible.Plant.Pathology/blob/master/vignettes/Assigning_Articles.Rmd) vignette.

#### "journal"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Name of journal

Entered as character string in title case

#### "year"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Year the article was published

Entered as a 4-digit number.

#### "contains_page"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Randomly selected page number which is used to select article for evaluation.
The article is selected if it contains this page number in its page range.

#### "assignee"

Auto-generated in Assigning Articles

Randomly assigned evaluator selected from Adam, Emerson, Nik or Zach and
assigned to a particular article (row)

### Manually entered metadata

### "doi"

Articles are looked up by Adam using the "article_notes" sheet in googlesheets.
The DOI is entered as a character string or left as `NA` if one is not
provided.

Entered as a character string.

### "comments"

Comments column, Adam has used this to enter comments regarding article
selection in cases where the `contains_page` number does not align with
our criteria. Can be used by evaluator for other comments on the article
when evaluating.

Entered as a character string.

### "IF_5year"

Nik has looked up and provided the five-year impact factor for each journal and
entered it in the "article_notes".

Entered as a decimal value.

### Evaluation of reproducibility

#### "country"

The country where the corresponding author works

Entered as a 3 letter ISO code (_e.g._, Netherlands = `NLD`)

#### "open"

Whether the journal is open-access or not

Entered as `TRUE`/`FALSE`/`BOTH`

#### "repro_inst"

Does the journal have guidelines for reproducibility?

- `0` - Not mentioned

- `1` - At least a suggestion to put data online, but not details on how/where.

- `2` - Detailed intructions on where to place data

- `3` - Detailed intructions on where to place data and code

#### "iss_per_year"

The number of articles per year the journal publishes

Entered as a number without commas

#### "art_class"

What kind of research the article describes

One or more of the following:

- `Fundamental`

- `Applied`

- `Molecular`

Entered as an R `vector` object in comma-separated list with spaces.

For example: `c("Applied"", "Molecular")` or `Fundamental`

#### "supl_mats"

Does the article supply supplemental materials?

Entered as `TRUE`/`FALSE`

#### "comp_mthds_avail"

Score of computational methods documentation

Are the computational methods used readily available, _e.g._, R, SAS, Python
scripts are shared?

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - Not available and not mentioned in publication

- `1` - Available upon request to author

- `2` - Online, but inconvenient/non-permanent (_e.g._, login necessary,
pay wall, FTP server, personal lab website)

- `3` - Freely available online to anonymous users for foreseeable future
(_e.g_, GitHub, Figshare, Dataverse)

#### "software_avail"

Score of software availability

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - Not available or not mentioned in the publication

- `1` - Uses expensive proprietary software that only institutions would
typically purchase (_i.e._, ArcGIS standard is $7000)

- `2` - Uses proprietary software that most individuals can afford (_e.g._,
Excel, Matlab? ($500))

- `3` - Uses entirely open source and free software (_e.g._, R, Python).

#### "software_cite"

Score of citations for software used

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - Not available or not mentioned in the publication

- `1` - Software mentioned by name only

- `2` - Attempts at citing software used

- `3` - All software used properly cited

#### "software_used"

Entered as an R `vector` object in comma-separated list with spaces.

For example: `c("R", "TableTool")` or `R`

#### "analysis_auto"

Is analysis automated, _e.g._ fully scripted and reproducible by downloading
and running the scripts or was it point and click type of work?

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - Methods not described or fully point and click

- `1` - Methods were mostly point and click

- `2` - Methods were mostly automated

- `3` - Methods were fully automated

#### "data_avail"
  
Raw data availability score

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - Not available or not mentioned in the publication

- `1` - Available upon request to author

- `2` - Online, but inconvenient/non-permanent (_e.g._ login needed, pay wall,
FTP server, personal lab website)

- `3` - Freely available online to anonymous users for foreseeable future

#### "data_annot"

Raw data annotation score.

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - No annotation

- `1` - The structure/content of the data is clear, but the relevance to the
study is not

- `2` - Fully understandable in the context of the paper

- `3` - Fully understandable without reading the paper

#### "data_tidy"

Raw data tidiness score

Entered as a number between `0` and `3`

- `0` - Not easily parsed with code or loaded by standard office software
(_e.g._, unstructured raw text or binary equipment outputs or no raw data)

- `1` - Difficult, but possible, to parse with code or manipulate with standard
office software (_i.e._ you technically could, but would not want to)

- `2` - Able to parse using code with minimal clean-up (_e.g._, you might need
a few extra lines of code for clean up or do a few extra steps to work with
your
operating system. An example would be a text file with multiple tables)

- `3` - Tidy data in a standardized format (_e.g._, TSV) that is loaded
correctly without clean-up or using uncommon parsing tools.

#### "reproducibility_score"

Sum of the prior scores that are scored on a `0` - `3` scale. A score of `0` is
not reproducible a score of `21` is perfectly reproducible based on the
criteria agreed upon for this article.
